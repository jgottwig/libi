# Smart read more link

## INTRODUCTION 
Drupal module that provides a dynamic read more link for body text.

It acts like the core Summary or Trimmed Text formatter, except 
that when its output is not the full body it adds a read more link. 
This makes it possible for the site builder to create a teaser style 
which only shows "Read more" when there is more to read.

This formatter is only suited to simple content types which have 
a single long text field. It is more of an proof of concept than 
a fully fledged module at the moment.

## REQUIREMENTS 
There are not any special requirements.

## INSTALLATION 
Install "Smart Read more link" module and enable it. 
Add the "Smart read more link" formatter" to a field.

## CONFIGURATION
Setup on the require "Display format" field the required number of 
chars to be included (shown).
